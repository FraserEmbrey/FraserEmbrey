[![Hey there, my name is Fraser. Welcome to my GitHub.][banner]][mysite]

I am a photographer and designer based in southeast UK. UX/UI and product design are my main interests.

💼 Working at a London-based company on software and hardware projects, writing documentation, research and grant applications incl. creating presentations and videos.

🌱 Currently learning react and SwiftUI. Outside of code I am learning Japanese 🇯🇵.

🙋‍♂️ I’d love any advice on learning react, SwiftUI, font design and book recommendations.

💪 Experienced with Figma, Sketch and more. Languages I am familiar with: HTML/CSS + JS, python, R, fish & bash.

💬 Ask me about CSS, typography and baking recipes!

🤽🏻‍♂️ In my free time I take photographs 📸, bake 🧑‍🍳 and care for my growing collection of plants 🌴. I am an active sailor and also play waterpolo.

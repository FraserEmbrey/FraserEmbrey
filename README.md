[![Hey there, my name is Fraser. Welcome to my GitHub.][banner]][mysite]

# Hey 👋

My passion is good, simple design. My strengths lie in understanding systems and fairly acute attention to detail.

Academically my main interest is particle physics, while I maintain an interest the philosophy of physics, in particular the nature of spacetime.

I find myself recently fascinated by applications of geometric analysis to physics. <samp>(_As examples: [1][physics1], [2][physics2]_)</samp>

My current rôle involves designing, developing and testing a novel platform for collaboration which is being designed for an IoT future.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Gatsby which I hope to use for my personal site, I also want to learn SwiftUI and Rust. Outside of code I am learning Japanese 🇯🇵.
- 🙋‍♂️ I’d love any advice on learning react, font design, iOS development and book recommendations. If you want to work with me on anything please let me know.
- 💪 I mostly write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also write bash, zsh and fish scripts fairly often. I have experience with R and python.
- 💬 Ask me about CSS, typography and baking recipes!
- My preferred pronouns are they/them.
- In my free time I take photographs 📸, bake 🧑‍🍳 and care for my growing collection of plants 🌴.
- I advocate for freedom of expression, privacy and open source.

I’m a fan of [BSD][runBSD]. My main computer runs macOS but I have OpenBSD and pop_os! running on other machines and as VMs.
